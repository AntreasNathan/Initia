Initia is a simple open world game created in Java. It serves as an introductory project to explore core concepts of 2D game development, such as rendering, tile-based maps, and player movement. The game currently features a large, walkable environment where the player can freely move around a 50x50 tile map using keyboard controls. While there is no storyline or interactive elements yet, this early version lays the foundation for more complex features in the future. The map is composed of different tile types including grass, walls, water, earth, trees, and sand, each represented by a unique number for easy customization and expansion. This project was built with Java 17+ and is compatible with common IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse. To run the game, simply run the .sh files given and launch the main class. Future updates may include map interaction, inventory systems, and NPCs. Initia is open source and available under the MIT License.
